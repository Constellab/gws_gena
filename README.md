# Genome-based Analytics (Gena)

GENA stands for Genome-Based Network Analysis. GENA provides core features to create and use actionable digital twins of cell metabolism to understand and predict cell mechanisms of action.

GENA goes from genomes to extract enzymatic regulations of living cells, reconstruct their whole-genome metabolic networks and create actionable digital twins. These models are simulated by computing the asymptotic distribution of metabolic fluxes into living cells, taking into account metabolic contexts. Several levels of digital twins can be created depending on the level of data used; the highest level models corresponding to models contextualized using environmental culture data (e.g. transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics data, etc.).
